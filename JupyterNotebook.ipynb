    "    import nbformat\n",
    "    from nbconvert import PythonExporter\n",
    "\n",

    "    with open(\"your_script.py\", \"w\") as f:\n",
    "        f.write(source)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is useful if you're working within Python and want to programmatically handle notebook files. Each method will give you a `.py` file with code and any Markdown cells as comments."
